# Introduction

## About This Workshop
In this workshop, we will see how to build AI Agent using Oracle Digital Assistant.

The lab does not use any code, all is done with Oracle Digital Assistant low code and intuitive user interface.

Here is a a **definition of an AI Agent**: 
- An AI agent interacts autonomously with its environment, and uses tools and data to perform self-determined tasks to meet predetermined goals.Â

Unlike normal programming language, an AI Agent decides itself what steps and what actions to use to reach the goal.

Practically that means that an agent has:
- **Tools**
- **Data**

that he may use. He will **decide himself which tool or data** to use to answer the the reach the **goal** and produce the desired **result**. In the root of an Agent we have a Large Language Model. During the lab, we will use Oracle Digital LLM blocks, who allows to use a Large Language Model of our choice

### Logical Architecture

There will be a several architectures of AI Agents in this LiveLab. 
- First, **a single agent** with tools and data. 
- **A router** with a single agent that will route the request to a tool or get data.

Then more complex architectures, where we will see how to use memory, how to make multi-agent installation and we will finish with several example of multi-agent systems.
- **Reflection**
- **Human in the loop**
- **Supervisor**, ....

### Physical Architecture

The physical architecture is mostly Oracle Digital Assistant that in the practice should call REST API for the tool.
In the lab, we will keep thing easy to install by using public API or faking the API with static JSON payloads.

### Objectives

- Provision Oracle Digital Assistant
- Import all the sample and test them
